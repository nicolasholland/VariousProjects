    "There are many different machine learning packages out there. We want to have a look at the most popular ones and see how we can use them to solve a well known problem. MNIST has become the \"hello world\" of machine learning. It is a dataset containing images of handwritten digits and labels and the goal is to train a model that can classify the images correctly. In this notebook we use scikit-learn and Tensor Flow and we are especially interested in the necessary steps to get from 'I have data' to 'I have a trained model'."

    "When using scikit-learn (and machine learning in general) we often have to make decisions that influence how good our models can be. We have to decide what algorithm to use, what model to use or what model parameters to use. These problems have lead to researchers looking into how to automate machine learning itself. Think of it as 'We want to learn how to learn\". There is an interesting package called auto-sklearn which is build on top of scikit-learn. In our first example we decided to use a support vector machine with an input parameter. When we run the same example again, but with auto-sklearn the auto classifier will choose an algorithm and input parameters for us. The example is from https://automl.github.io/auto-sklearn/stable/."
